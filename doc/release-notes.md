Dash Core version 0.16
======================

Release is now available from:

  <https://www.dash.org/downloads/#wallets>

This is a new major version release, bringing new features, various bugfixes
and other improvements.

This release is mandatory for all nodes.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github:

  <https://github.com/dashpay/dash/issues>


Upgrading and downgrading
=========================

How to Upgrade
--------------

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Dash-Qt (on Mac) or
pigeond/pigeon-qt (on Linux). If you upgrade after DIP0003 activation and you were
using version < 0.13 you will have to reindex (start with -reindex-chainstate
or -reindex) to make sure your wallet has all the new data synced. Upgrading
from version 0.13 should not require any additional actions.

When upgrading from a version prior to 0.14.0.3, the
first startup of Dash Core will run a migration process which can take a few
minutes to finish. After the migration, a downgrade to an older version is only
possible with a reindex (or reindex-chainstate).

Downgrade warning
-----------------

### Downgrade to a version < 0.14.0.3

Downgrading to a version older than 0.14.0.3 is no longer supported due to
changes in the "evodb" database format. If you need to use an older version,
you must either reindex or re-sync the whole chain.

### Downgrade of masternodes to < 0.16

Starting with this release, masternodes will verify the protocol version of other
masternodes. This will result in PoSe punishment/banning for outdated masternodes,
so downgrading is not recommended.

Notable changes
===============

Block Reward Reallocation
-------------------------
This version implements Block Reward Reallocation which was proposed in order
to slow the growth rate of Dashâ€™s circulating supply by encouraging the
formation of masternodes and was voted in by the network. The resulting allocation
will split all non-proposal block rewards 40% toward miners and 60% toward
masternodes in the end-state once the transition period is complete.

The reallocation will take place over 4.5 years with a total of 18 reallocation
periods between the start and end state. The transition is being made gradually
to avoid market volatility and minimize network disruption.

Note that this is a hardfork which must be activated by miners. To do this they
should start creating blocks signalling bit 5 in the `version` field of the block header.

### Reallocation periods

Each reallocation period will last three superblock cycles (approximately one
quarter). The following table shows the split of the non-proposal block rewards during
each period.

|Event|Miner|Masternode|
|--|-----|-----|
|Now|50.0%|50.0%|
|1 |48.7%|51.3%|
|2 |47.4%|52.6%|
|3 |46.7%|53.3%|
|4 |46.0%|54.0%|
|5 |45.4%|54.6%|
|6 |44.8%|55.2%|
|7 |44.3%|55.7%|
|8 |43.8%|56.2%|
|9 |43.3%|56.7%|
|10|42.8%|57.2%|
|11|42.3%|57.7%|
|12|41.8%|58.2%|
|13|41.5%|58.5%|
|14|41.2%|58.8%|
|15|40.9%|59.1%|
|16|40.6%|59.4%|
|17|40.3%|59.7%|
|18|40.1%|59.9%|
|End|40.0%|60.0%|

Dynamic Activation Thresholds
-----------------------------
In Dash we have used lower thresholds (80% vs 95% in BTC) to activate upgrades
via a BIP9-like mechanism for quite some time. While it's preferable to have as much
of the network hashrate signal update readiness as possible, this can result in
quite lengthy upgrades if one large non-upgraded entity stalls
all progress. Simply lowering thresholds even further can result in network
upgrades occurring too quickly and potentially introducing network instability. This version
implements BIP9-like dynamic activation thresholds which drop from some initial
level to a minimally acceptable one over time at an increasing rate. This provides
a safe non-blocking way of activating proposals.

This mechanism applies to the Block Reward Reallocation proposal mentioned above.
Its initial threshold is 80% and it will decrease to a minimum of 60% over the
course of 10 periods. Each period is 4032 blocks (approximately one week).

Concentrated Recovery
---------------------
In the current system, signature shares are propagated to all LLMQ members
until one of them has collected enough shares to recover the signature. All
members keep propagating and verifying each share until this recovered signature
is propagated in the LLMQ. This causes significant load on the LLMQ and results
in decreased throughput.

This new system initially sends all shares to a single deterministically selected node,
so that this node can recover the signature and propagate the recovered signature.
This way only the recovered signature needs to be propagated and verified by all
members. After sending their share to this node, each member waits for a
timeout and then sends their share to another deterministically selected member.
This process is repeated until a recovered signature is finally created and propagated.

This timeout begins at two seconds and increases exponentially up to ten seconds
(i.e. `2,4,8,10,10`) for each node that times out. This is to minimize the time
taken to generate a signature if the recovery node is down, while also
minimizing the traffic generated when the network is under stress.

The new system is activated with the newly added `SPORK_21_QUORUM_ALL_CONNECTED`
which has two hardcoded values with a special meaning: `0` activates Concentrated
Recovery for every LLMQ and `1` excludes `400_60` and `400_85` quorums.

Increased number of masternode connections
------------------------------------------
To implement "Concentrated Recovery", it is now necessary for all members of a LLMQ
to connect to all other members of the same LLMQ. This significantly increases the general
connection count for masternodes. Although these intra-quorum connections are less resource
intensive than normal p2p connections (as they only exchange LLMQ/masternode related
messages), masternode hardware and network requirements will still be higher than before.

Initially this change will only be activated for the smaller LLMQs (50 members).
Eventually it may be activated for larger quorums (400 members).

This is also controlled via `SPORK_21_QUORUM_ALL_CONNECTED`.

Masternode Connection Probing
-----------------------------
While each LLMQ member must have a connection to each other member, it's not necessary
for all members to actually connect to all other members. This is because only
one of a pair of two masternodes need to initiate the connection while the other one can
wait for an incoming connection. Probing is done in the case where a masternode doesn't
really need an outbound connection, but still wants to verify that the other side
has its port open. This is done by initiating a short lived connection, waiting
for `MNAUTH` to succeed and then disconnecting again.

After this process, each member of a LLMQ knows which members are unable to accept
connections, after which they will vote on these members to be "bad".

Masternode Minimum Protocol Version Checks
------------------------------------------
Members of LLMQs will now also check all other members for minimum protocol versions
while in DKG. If a masternode determines that another LLMQ member has a protocol
version that is too low, it will vote for the other member to be "bad".

PoSe punishment/banning
-----------------------
If 80% of all LLMQ members voted for the same member to be bad, it is excluded
in the final stages of the DKG. This causes the bad masternode to get PoSe punished
and then eventually PoSe banned.

Network performance improvements
--------------------------------
This version of Dash Core includes multiple optimizations to the network and p2p message
handling code. The most important one is the introduction of `epoll` on linux-based
systems. This removes most of the CPU overhead caused by the sub-optimal use of `select`,
which could easily use up 50-80% of the CPU time spent in the network thread when many
connections were involved.

Since these optimizations are exclusive to linux, it is possible that masternodes hosted
on windows servers will be unable to handle the network load and should consider migrating
to a linux based operating system.

Other improvements were made to the p2p message handling code, so that LLMQ
related connections do less work than full/normal p2p connections.

Wallet files
------------
The `--wallet=<path>` option now accepts full paths instead of requiring
wallets to be located in the `-walletdir` directory.

If `--wallet=<path>` is specified with a path that does not exist, it will now
create a wallet directory at the specified location (containing a `wallet.dat`
data file, a `db.log` file, and `database/log.??????????` files) instead of just
creating a data file at the path and storing log files in the parent
directory. This should make backing up wallets more straightforward than
before because the specified wallet path can just be directly archived without
having to look in the parent directory for transaction log files.

For backwards compatibility, wallet paths that are names of existing data files
in the `--walletdir` directory will continue to be accepted and interpreted the
same as before.

When Dash Core is not started with any `--wallet=<path>` options, the name of
the default wallet returned by `getwalletinfo` and `listwallets` RPCs is
now the empty string `""` instead of `"wallet.dat"`. If Dash Core is started
with any `--wallet=<path>` options, there is no change in behavior, and the
name of any wallet is just its `<path>` string.

PrivateSend coin management improvements
----------------------------------------
A new algorithm for the creation of mixing denominations was implemented which
should reduce the number of the smallest inputs created and give users more
control on soft and hard caps. A much more accurate fee management algorithm was
also implemented which should fix issues for users who have custom fees
specified in wallet config or in times when network is under load.

There is a new "PrivateSend" tab in the GUI which allows spending fully
mixed coins only. The CoinControl feature was also improved to display coins
based on the tab it was opened in, to protect users from accidentally spending
mixed and non-mixed coins in the same transaction and to give better overview of
spendable mixed coins.

PrivateSend Random Round Mixing
-------------------------------
Some potential attacks on PrivateSend assume that all inputs had been mixed
for the same number of rounds (up to 16). While this assumption alone is not
enough to break PrivateSend privacy, it could still provide some additional
information for other methods like cluster analysis and help to narrow results.

With Random Round Mixing, an input will be mixed to N rounds like prior. However,
at this point, a salted hash of each input is used to pick ~50% of inputs to
be mixed for another round. This rule is then executed again on the new inputs.
This results in an exponential decay where if you mix a set
of inputs, half of those inputs will be mixed for N rounds, 1/4 will be mixed N+1,
1/8 will be mixed N+2, etc. Current implementation caps it at N+3 which results
in mixing an average of N+0.875 rounds and sounds like a reasonable compromise
given the privacy gains.

GUI changes
-----------
All dialogs, tabs, icons, colors and interface elements were reworked to improve
user experience, let the wallet look more consistent and to make the GUI more
flexible. There is a new "Appearance setup" dialog that will show up on the first start
of this version and a corresponding tab has been added to the options which allows the
user to pick a theme and to tweak the font family, the font weight and the font size.
This feature specifically should help users who had font size/scaling issues previously.

For advanced users and developers there is a new way to control the wallet's look
by specifying a path to custom css files via `--custom-css-dir`. Additionally, the new
`--debug-ui` will force Dash Core to reload the custom css files as soon as they get updated
which makes it possible to see and debug all css adjustments live in the running GUI.

From now on the "Pay To" field in "Send" and "PrivateSend" tabs also accepts Dash URIs.
The Dash address and the amount from the URI are assigned to corresponding fields automatically
if a Dash URI gets pasted into the field.

Sporks
------
Two new sporks were introduced in this version:
- `SPORK_21_QUORUM_ALL_CONNECTED` allows to control Concentrated Recovery and
Masternode Probing activation;
- `SPORK_22_PS_MORE_PARTICIPANTS` raises the number of users that can participate
in a single PrivateSend mixing transaction to 20.

Sporks `SPORK_15_DETERMINISTIC_MNS_ENABLED`, `SPORK_16_INSTANTSEND_AUTOLOCKS`
and `SPORK_20_INSTANTSEND_LLMQ_BASED` which were previously deprecated in v0.15
are completely removed now. `SPORK_6_NEW_SIGS` was never activated on mainnet
and was also removed in this version.

Build system
------------
The minimum version of the GCC compiler required to compile Dash Core is now 4.8.
The minimum version of Qt is now 5.5.1. Some packages in `depends/` as well as
`secp256k1` and `leveldb` subtrees were updated to newer versions.

RPC changes
-----------
There are a few changes in existing RPC interfaces in this release:
- `getpeerinfo` has new field `masternode` to indicate whether connection was
  due to masternode connection attempt
- `getprivatesendinfo` `denoms` field was replaced by `denoms_goal` and
  `denoms_hardcap`
- `listunspent` has new filter option `coinType` to be able to filter different
  types of coins (all, mixed etc.)
- `protx diff` returns more detailed information about new quorums
- `quorum dkgstatus` shows `quorumConnections` for each LLMQ with detailed
  information about each participating masternode
- `quorum sign` has an optional `quorumHash` argument to pick the exact quorum
- `socketevents` in `getnetworkinfo` rpc shows the socket events mode,
  either `epoll`, `poll` or `select`

There are also new RPC commands:
- `quorum selectquorum` returns the quorum that would/should sign a request

There are also new RPC commands backported from Bitcoin Core 0.16:
- `help-console` for more info about using console in Qt
- `loadwallet` loads a wallet from a wallet file or directory
- `rescanblockchain` rescans the local blockchain for wallet related transactions
- `savemempool` dumps the mempool to disk

External wallet files
---------------------

The `-wallet=<path>` option now accepts full paths instead of requiring wallets
to be located in the -walletdir directory.

Newly created wallet format
---------------------------

If `-wallet=<path>` is specified with a path that does not exist, it will now
create a wallet directory at the specified location (containing a wallet.dat
data file, a db.log file, and database/log.?????????? files) instead of just
creating a data file at the path and storing log files in the parent
directory. This should make backing up wallets more straightforward than
before because the specified wallet path can just be directly archived without
having to look in the parent directory for transaction log files.

For backwards compatibility, wallet paths that are names of existing data files
in the `-walletdir` directory will continue to be accepted and interpreted the
same as before.

Low-level RPC changes
---------------------

- When Dash Core is not started with any `-wallet=<path>` options, the name of
  the default wallet returned by `getwalletinfo` and `listwallets` RPCs is
  now the empty string `""` instead of `"wallet.dat"`. If Dash Core is started
  with any `-wallet=<path>` options, there is no change in behavior, and the
  name of any wallet is just its `<path>` string.
